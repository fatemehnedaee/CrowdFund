# CrowdFund

Crowdfunding in Solidity is the process of using a Solidity smart contract to raise funds from a large number of people for a specific purpose.

To create a CrowdFunding smart contract, the campaign creator must first define the following parameters:

- Funding goal: The amount of money that the campaign creator needs to raise.

- Deadline: The date by which the campaign creator must reach the funding goal.

Once the smart contract is deployed, backers can send funds to the smart contract address. The smart contract will keep track of the total amount raised and the number of backers.

If the funding goal is met before the deadline, tthe campaign creator will withdraw the funds. If the funding goal is not met,the backers can withdraw their funds.
